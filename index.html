<h2>Well, hello there.</h2>

<p>I'm in between my junior and senior years, studying <b>Technical Writing + Communication</b> with the Biology and Medicine subplan. My two minors are in <b>Pharmacology</b> and <b>Linguistics</b>.</p>

<h3>Professional</h3>

<p>My ideal career lies at the intersection of health policy, administrative law, and regulatory affairs, both in drug development and delivery of care. There are many roads leading to such a career, but so far I'm leaning toward public health school, law school, or some combination of the two. If it's pertinent to gastroenterology, all the better as that's a specialty personal to me.</p>

<p>I say all of this like it's the end-all, be-all of my life. Of course, it isn't. Tech comm is a vast field, and my love for learning about anything and everything has allowed me to diversify my opportunities. Last summer I interned with Advanced Training Systems, a metro-based company which produces specialized robotic equipment for the defense, law enforcement, and energy security sectors. In this role, I both updated documentation for and assembled my way through the product line, giving me a unique background in mechanical engineering and machining which can transfer to other industries.</p>

<h3>Interests</h3>

<p>When I'm not studying, you'll likely find me moving in some manner. These days, it's usually pickleball and partner dance, both ballroom and swing. At home in Waconia, I enjoy zooming down bike trails and teaching at a local karate studio, where I am currently working on a third-degree black belt.</p>
